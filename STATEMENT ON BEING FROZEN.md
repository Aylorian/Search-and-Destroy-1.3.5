# Statement on being frozen - 1 Jun 2018

At 05:06 (Aardwolf server time) on Saturday, 12 May 2018, I was frozen for inappropriate conduct towards
an immortal.  The length of the freeze is about 3 months.  The incident was completely my fault and the punishment
is fair.  This posting is intended to clear up any concerns regarding Search and Destroy that people may have.

- Search and Destroy has nothing to do with my being frozen whatsoever.  I'm frozen for harassing an imm, and
that is all.  While that behavior is inappropriate, it is not an integrity violation or other violation of user
trust, and should not be considered as such.

- Search and Destroy is still legal.  As downloaded from my Github, it is not considered a bot.  Users are
still responsible for any modifications they make to the plugins (e.g. automation) and any consequences arising
from that.  If you plan on modifying your copy of S&D, please check with the immortals to confirm that the changes
you're making are actually legal.

- S&D is safe to run.  The only data it accesses is your mapper DB and the plugin state files.  It does not
access any other data on your system, does not contain malicious code of any kind, does not log your commands
or keystrokes, and all of S&D's code is available here on Github.  Feel free to inspect it at any time.  There 
are plenty of coders on Aardwolf who are better than I am, and to date not one of them has raised any trust 
issues at all.  

- Unless details, evidence, and/or reasoning are provided, then any claim that S&D is unsafe, and/or any comment like 
"I wouldn't trust code written by a frozen player" is a scare tactic (a rather transparent one, at that) intended
to discourage people from using S&D and these comments should be disregarded accordingly.  I guess if you can't convince 
people it's a bot then scaring them into thinking it's malware is a logical next step.  Unfortunately, examining the code
will show that S&D isn't malware any more than it's a bot.  If anyone believes otherwise, it's on them to prove it.  I won't be holding my breath, though.

- I very likely won't update S&D while frozen because of the difficulty with testing anything.  I won't be
lurking on an alt or talking to anyone in-game while frozen â€” I think it would be problematic given the circumstances.
That being said, S&D 1.3.5 should be pretty stable at this point, with most of the GUI and other list/display related 
glitches and crashes fixed. I'm sure it can still crash in other ways, but if it does, it's due to a coding error (bug) 
and not because S&D is doing something to your computer (as certain implementors would have you believe).

I sincerely regret any inconvenience that my being frozen has caused, and look forward to continuing active
work on S&D when I return.  I hope this clears up any concerns or worries that anyone might have, given the comments that
have been made In the meantime, any questions, concerns, comments, or other messages should be directed 
to my email, which can be found in my in-game finger info.  See you all after 19:42 (Aardwolf server time) on Friday, 
10 August 2018.
